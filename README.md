# nice-backgrounds-templates

<h2 text-align:"left">Page with a different backgrounds for inspiration and experimenting (HTML+CSS)</h2>

For now, I will only be using HTML and CSS.
The goal is to provide a set of different backgrounds that can be picked up and used as backgrounds for the website, or for app interface background, but also as backgrounds for different HTML elements (like buttons or containers), so I will try to make them work well in smaller sizes as well.

CONTENT

This page simply displays a grid of elements, with each one showcasing different way of applying a background to the element.

It serves as a reference point and template code you can copy-paste and use "as-is" or modify it by your own
By creating a grouped series of examples, you will end up with a reference tool and a place to experiment with different background properties. You will create a sheet of 18 background color, image, and gradient variations. Each variation will use background-related properties to achieve a particular effect. The last variation will combine many approaches on a single element, creating a multiple-background effect.
